# Simple Javascript Cube Animation

The code snippet is responsible for animating a square on a canvas element. It starts by drawing a square on the canvas and then repeatedly moves the square to the right until it reaches the end of the canvas.

## Inputs
The code snippet requires a canvas element with the id "canvas" to be present in the HTML document.

## Flow
The code initializes the canvas and sets the stroke style and line width.
It starts a new path and moves the pen to the specified coordinates.
The path is rendered on the canvas.
A blue square is drawn on the canvas at the specified coordinates.
The code then loops through the canvas width, clearing the canvas and drawing a square at each iteration.
A variable x is initialized to 0 and a setInterval function is used to repeatedly move the square to the right by updating the x value.
If the square reaches the end of the canvas, the interval is cleared.
Outputs
The code snippet animates a square moving from left to right on a canvas.

## Usage example
### HTML
```html
<canvas id="canvas"></canvas>

```
### JavaScript
```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
ctx.strokeStyle = 'black';
ctx.lineWidth = 5;
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(100, 50);
ctx.stroke();
ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';
ctx.fillRect(100, 100, 30, 30);

const size = 30;
ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';

for (let x = 0; x < canvas.width; x += size) {
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    ctx.fillRect(x, 50, size, size);
}

let x = 0;
const id = setInterval(() => {
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    ctx.fillRect(x, 50, size, size);
    x += size;

    if (x >= canvas.width) {
        clearInterval(id);
    }
}, 100);```

In this example, a canvas element with the id "canvas" is created in the HTML. The JavaScript code initializes the canvas, sets the stroke style and line width, and draws a square on the canvas. It then loops through the canvas width, clearing the canvas and drawing a square at each iteration. Finally, it animates the square moving from left to right using a setInterval function.
